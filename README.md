# image-gallery
 An small image gallery project made during the course "Programador FullStack Angular7/Node: Proj WEB Galeria Imagem" on Udemy. In this app was used Angular, Node, Xampp and Express.

* To use this app you will need to install Xampp, and on the phpadmin create the database: db_galeria.
  * In rest-api/banco has a file 'script-table.sql', wich you can you to create your table.
* Inside each folder (back and front) run 'npm install' command.
* Turn on xampp and start apache and mysql.
* Run 'nodemon api' inside rest-api folder.
* Run 'npm start' inside web-app folder.

Hope this helps!
